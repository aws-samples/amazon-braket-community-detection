## Community Detection in Complex Networks using Hybrid Quantum Annealing on Amazon Braket

This code package is for solving network community detection problems using hybrid quantum annealing on Amazon Braket. 

### Quick Start

The tutorial notebook [`Notebook_QBSolv_community_detection`](Notebook_QBSolv_community_detection.ipynb) provides a step-by-step guide on how to formulate community detection as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, similar to the work done by [Negre et. al](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0227538). We then demonstrate how to use the open source QBSolv library, which provides quantum-classical hybrid solvers for QUBO problems, using a combination of classical compute resources and D-Wave quantum annealers, to solve community detection problems on Amazon Braket.

**Table of Contents for the Tutorial Notebook**
* Modularity-based community detection
* Community detection as a QUBO problem
* Datasets
* List of key functions for community detection
* Set up environment
* Download graph data
* Prepare graph data for community detection
* Apply QBSolv for community detection
* Detect communities for synthetic and real-world networks

The Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs notebook [`Hybrid_jobs_for_community_detection`](Hybrid_jobs_for_community_detection.ipynb) provides a step-by-step guide on how to use Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs to seamlessly manage and execute quantum annealing-based community detection tasks at scale.
